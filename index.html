        Walnut 5.4 is now available! It contains several new commands, including the ability to do transductions of
        automatic sequences, and fixes one obscure bug introduced in Walnut 3: namely, regular expressions with negative
        elements could under some rare circumstances be interpreted incorrectly. This version was modified by Anatoly
        Zavyalov. This version supersedes all previous versions.
